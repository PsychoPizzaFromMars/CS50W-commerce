# CS50W-commerce
[Commerce](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/projects/2/commerce/) is a CS50W course learning project on [edX](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50W+Web/course/), where I have implemented simple ebay-like e-commerce auction site.

What I have learned making this project:
- creating and handling Django models and forms
- Django template syntax
- setting up Django admin interface
- building database
- using CSS with Bootstrap framework
